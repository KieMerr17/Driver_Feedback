                            "We had one situation where we were the first vehicle at red lights at a pedestrian crossing, the lights changed to green and the AV began to drive on, however there was a pedestrian on the left that had begun crossing and was increasing her pace to go across us. Kamran had not intervened until I asked him to stop the car. I asked Kamran why he didn’t stop the car when he saw her, he said by the time he did his all around checks, he didnt realise that she would increase her pace and continue to cross. We spoke about the importance of stopping the model as soon as you see any potential hazard with pedestrians, even if we have a green light. \n"

                            "- Kamran needs to bring the car up to a good speed before engaging back in AV, as otherwise it slows significantly before picking up speed again posing a hazard to following vehicles \n"
